# Smart-Watering-Of-Plants
A smart watering system for plants automates the irrigation process to ensure plants receive the right amount of water based on environmental conditions.
The objective of this project is to design and implement a smart watering of plants that aims to minimize water wastage by delivering water precisely when and where
it is needed. By leveraging sensors and data analysis, the system ensures that plantsreceive adequate hydration without overwatering, thereby conserving water
resources and mitigating the risk of drought.
